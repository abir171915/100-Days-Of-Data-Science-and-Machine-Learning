# 100-Days-Of-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning
Day-wise hands-on learning in Data Science and ML

This repository tracks my 100-day journey through data science and machine learning projects.

## Day 1: UK Room Rent Analysis
Analyzed average room rent across UK regions (2022–2023) using pandas, matplotlib, and KNN imputation.

- [Original dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/datasets/privaterentalmarketsummarystatisticsinengland)
